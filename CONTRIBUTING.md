## 🔄 Pull Request Process

### Branch Naming

Follow our branch naming conventions:

```

fix/<issue-number>-<description> # Bug fixes
docs/<what>                     # Documentation updates
refactor/<module>               # Code refactoring
test/<feature>                  # Test additions
```

**For Copilot agents**, use the `copilot/` prefix:
```
copilot/feat/<description>
copilot/fix/<issue>-<description>
copilot/docs/<what>
```

### Commit Messages

Use conventional commit messages:

```
feat(auth): add password reset validation
fix(api): resolve null pointer in user lookup

## 🎨 Coding Standards

### General Principles

- **Keep it simple**: Write clear, readable code
- **Follow conventions**: Use established patterns and naming
- **Document complex logic**: Add comments for non-obvious code
- **Test your changes**: Include appropriate test coverage
- **Security first**: Never commit secrets or credentials

### Language-Specific Guidelines

#### Python (when applicable)
- Follow **PEP 8** style guidelines
- Use **type hints** for function parameters and returns
- Write **docstrings** for all public functions and classes
- Use **Black** for code formatting
- Use **flake8** for linting

#### JavaScript/TypeScript (when applicable)
- Follow **ESLint** configuration
- Use **Prettier** for code formatting
- Prefer **const/let** over var
- Use **async/await** over callbacks
- Write **JSDoc** comments for complex functions

#### Documentation
- Use **clear, concise language**
- Include **code examples** where helpful
- Keep **README.md** up to date
- Document **breaking changes** in PRs

## 🧪 Testing

### Testing Philosophy

- **Test behavior, not implementation**
- **Cover edge cases** and error conditions
- **Keep tests simple** and focused
- **Use descriptive test names**

### Testing Guidelines

When the project includes code:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test        # Node.js
pytest          # Python
make test       # Make-based projects

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
pytest --cov
```

### Test Structure

```python
# Python example
def test_should_calculate_profit_margin_correctly():
    # Given
    cost = 10.00
    selling_price = 15.00
    
    # When
    margin = calculate_profit_margin(cost, selling_price)
    
    # Then
    assert margin == 0.33  # 33% margin
```
