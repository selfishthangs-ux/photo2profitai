# Fixing the "Site Not Found" Error

## Problem
You're seeing a "Site Not Found" error when trying to access your Firebase Hosting site. This typically happens when:

1. ✅ **No app has been deployed yet** - The most common reason
2. ⚠️ An empty directory was deployed
3. ⚠️ Custom domain is not fully configured

## Solution: Deploy the Landing Page

We've now added Firebase Hosting configuration and a landing page to fix this issue. Here's what was added:

### Files Added

1. **`firebase.json`** - Firebase Hosting configuration
2. **`.firebaserc`** - Firebase project settings
3. **`public/index.html`** - Landing page
4. **`public/styles.css`** - Styling
5. **`public/app.js`** - JavaScript functionality
6. **`.github/workflows/firebase-deploy.yml`** - Automated deployment workflow
7. **`FIREBASE_SETUP.md`** - Complete setup guide

### Features Included

- ✅ Professional landing page with Photo2Profit branding
- ✅ Features, pricing, and how-it-works sections
- ✅ Integration with backend API (Railway)
- ✅ Real-time API status checking
- ✅ Founding member program counter
- ✅ Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- ✅ SEO-friendly HTML structure

## How to Deploy

### Option 1: Manual Deployment (Recommended for First Time)

1. **Install Firebase CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. **Login to Firebase**
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

3. **Initialize Firebase (if needed)**
   ```bash
   firebase init hosting
   ```
   - Select your Firebase project or create a new one
   - Set public directory to: `public`
   - Configure as single-page app: `No`
   - Don't overwrite existing files

4. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only hosting
   ```

5. **Access Your Site**
   - Default URL: `https://YOUR-PROJECT-ID.web.app`
   - Custom domain (if configured): Your custom URL

### Option 2: Automated GitHub Actions Deployment

The repository now includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically deploys to Firebase Hosting when you push to `main`.

**Setup Steps:**

1. **Get Firebase Token**
   ```bash
   firebase login:ci
   ```
   Copy the token that's displayed.

2. **Add Token to GitHub Secrets**
   - Go to: Repository Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `FIREBASE_TOKEN`
   - Value: Paste the token
   - Click "Add secret"

3. **Trigger Deployment**
   - Merge this PR to `main` branch
   - GitHub Actions will automatically deploy
   - Or manually trigger: Actions > Deploy to Firebase Hosting > Run workflow

## Verification

After deployment, verify everything is working:

1. **Check the Landing Page**
   - Visit: `https://YOUR-PROJECT-ID.web.app`
   - You should see the Photo2Profit landing page

2. **Verify API Integration**
   - Scroll to the bottom of the page
   - Check "System Status" section
   - It should show "Backend API: Online" (after a few seconds)

3. **Test Founding Member Counter**
   - Click "Join as Founding Member" button
   - Should show available spots (from backend API)

## Troubleshooting

### Still Seeing "Site Not Found"?

1. **Check Firebase Project ID**
   ```bash
   firebase projects:list
   ```
   Make sure `.firebaserc` has the correct project ID.

2. **Verify Deployment**
   ```bash
   firebase hosting:sites:list
   ```

3. **Check Deployment History**
   Go to Firebase Console > Hosting > View deployments

4. **Try Re-deploying**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only hosting --debug
   ```

### Custom Domain Issues?

If using a custom domain:
1. Verify DNS records in your domain registrar
2. Wait for SSL certificate (can take 24 hours)
3. Check Firebase Console > Hosting > Custom domains

### GitHub Actions Failing?

1. Ensure `FIREBASE_TOKEN` secret is set correctly
2. Check Actions logs for error messages
3. Verify `.firebaserc` has the correct project ID

## What's Next?

Now that the site is deployed:

1. ✅ Customize the content in `public/index.html`
2. ✅ Update branding, colors, and styles in `public/styles.css`
3. ✅ Add more features to `public/app.js`
4. ✅ Configure custom domain (optional)
5. ✅ Set up Firebase Analytics (optional)
6. ✅ Add more pages as needed
